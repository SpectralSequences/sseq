`ext-rs` is a collection of libraries for doing homological algebra over Fp.
The main and original purpose is to compute Ext of a Steenrod module, but the
library is written to be sufficiently generic to deal with more general
applications.

The library also comes with a number of "example" binaries that use the library
for various purposes. These can be used directly to perform specific
computations, or act as actual examples for how to use the library.

Since `ext-rs` is based on [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), one must install
Rust before using this library.

# Library documentation

Documentation for both the examples and the library itself is hosted at
[https://spectralsequences.github.io/sseq/docs/ext/](https://spectralsequences.github.io/sseq/docs/ext/).

If documentation for a specific version of the library is sought, it can be generated by running
```
$ make docs
```
after which the documentation is placed at `target/doc/`. The link above opens
the file `target/doc/ext/index.html`.

# Development
## Linting
Lint scripts can be run with
```
 $ make lint
```
This runs `clippy` and `rustfmt`.

## Tests
There are multiple types of tests

### Unit tests, doc tests and integration tests
These can be run by
```
 $ make test
```

### Example benchmarks
In the `examples/benchmarks/` folder, we have some benchmarks to test the
examples against. In each file, the first row specifies the argument to run
(the arguments after `cargo run --example`), and the rest of the file is what
the output should be.

These can be run by
```
 $ make benchmarks
 $ make benchmarks-concurrent
```

Running
```
 $ make fix-benchmarks
```
updates the outputs in all benchmark files to match the current program output.
This is useful for adding new benchmarks.

These can be run for individual benchmarks by e.g.
```
 $ make examples/benchmarks/resolve-S_2
 $ make examples/benchmarks/resolve-S_2-concurrent
 $ make examples/benchmarks/resolve-S_2-fixed
```
