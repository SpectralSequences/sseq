/// Internal methods required for fields.
///
/// A field has several responsibilities. It must define:
/// - what its elements "look like", i.e. how they are represented in memory;
/// - how to perform finite field operations on those elements, namely addition, subtraction,
///   multiplication, division (except by zero), and the Frobenius endomorphism;
/// - how to pack and unpack elements into and from `Limb`s, so that `FqVector` can handle them.
///
/// We want a trait that makes all those definitions. However, we don't want to expose these
/// implementation details to the outside world. Therefore, we define a public trait that defines
/// public field methods (e.g. constructing the zero element) and an internal trait that takes care
/// of the details. The latter trait is `FieldInternal`.
///
/// The fact that each field defines its own element type means that we can define a single struct
/// that packages both a field and one of its elements, and this struct will be how we expose field
/// operations to the outside world.
