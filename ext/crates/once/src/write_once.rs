/// A thread-safe, wait-free, write-once cell that allows a value to be set exactly once.
///
/// `WriteOnce` provides a way to initialize a value exactly once in a thread-safe manner. Once a
/// value is set, it cannot be changed. This is useful in scenarios where you need to ensure that a
/// value is initialized exactly once, even in the presence of concurrent access.
///
/// `WriteOnce` is similar to [`std::sync::OnceLock`], but with a key difference: it takes a value
/// directly rather than a closure that initializes the value. In other words, we assume an
/// optimistic concurrency model, contrary to `OnceLock`'s pessimistic model.
///
/// This concurrency model allows `WriteOnce` to be fully wait-free. This also implies that, whereas
/// `OnceLock` guarantees that the closure is called at most once, `WriteOnce` guarantees that the
/// value is *set* at most once.
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// `WriteOnce` is designed to be thread-safe and wait-free, allowing concurrent attempts to set the
/// value from multiple threads. Only the first successful call to `set` or `try_set` will
/// initialize the value; subsequent attempts will either panic (with `set`) or return an error
/// (with `try_set`).
///
/// # Memory Safety
///
/// `WriteOnce` uses atomic operations to ensure memory safety and proper synchronization between
/// threads. It guarantees that:
///
/// - A value can be set exactly once
/// - Once set, the value can be safely read from any thread
/// - The value is properly dropped when the `WriteOnce` is dropped
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use once::write_once::WriteOnce;
///
/// // Create a new WriteOnce with no value
/// let cell = WriteOnce::<String>::none();
///
/// // Set the value
/// cell.set("Hello, world!".to_string());
///
/// // Get the value
/// assert_eq!(cell.get(), Some(&"Hello, world!".to_string()));
///
/// // Attempting to set the value again will panic
/// // cell.set("Another value".to_string()); // This would panic
///
/// // Using try_set instead returns an error
/// let result = cell.try_set("Another value".to_string());
/// assert!(result.is_err());
/// if let Err(value) = result {
///     assert_eq!(value, "Another value".to_string());
/// }
