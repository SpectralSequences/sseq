/// A node in the K-dimensional trie structure.
///
/// This is an internal implementation detail of `KdTrie`. It uses a union to represent either an
/// inner node, which contains child nodes, or a leaf node, which contains values. This allows us to
/// store values in contiguous memory instead of creating a separate node for each value.
///
/// # Node Types
///
/// There are two types of nodes in the trie:
///
/// 1. **Inner Nodes**: These nodes contain child nodes and are used for all dimensions except the
///    last one. Each inner node is a [`TwoEndedGrove`] of other `Node` instances, allowing for
///    efficient storage of sparse child nodes.
///
/// 2. **Leaf Nodes**: These nodes contain the actual values and are used for the last dimension.
///    Each leaf node is a [`TwoEndedGrove`] of values of type `V`.
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// The `Node` struct is designed to be thread-safe and wait-free, allowing concurrent insertions
/// and retrievals from multiple threads. This is achieved through the use of atomic operations in
/// the underlying [`TwoEndedGrove`] data structure.
///
/// # Memory Management
///
/// The `Node` struct uses a Rust union to efficiently represent either an inner node or a leaf node
/// without the overhead of an enum discriminant. This approach saves memory but requires careful
/// manual memory management.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// It is the responsibility of the caller to know which variant is contained in the union. We only
/// use this in `KdTrie`, where we know which variant is contained based on the number of
/// dimensions.
///
/// The `inner` and `leaf` variants are wrapped in `ManuallyDrop`, because union fields can't have
/// drop glue. Unions don't know what they contain, and so can't know which drop implementation to
/// run. We delegate the responsibility of dropping the node to the `KdTrie`, using `drop_level`.
