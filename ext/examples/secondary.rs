//! This computes $d_2$ differentials in the Adams spectral sequence. This only works for fairly
//! specific modules, but tends to cover most cases of interest.
//!
//! In general, the set of possible $d_2$'s is a torsor over $\Ext^{2, 1}(M, M)$; the
//! action of $\chi \in \Ext^{2, 1}(M, M)$ is given by adding $\chi$-multiplication
//! to the $d_2$ map. This algorithm computes one possible set of $d_2$'s. If $\Ext^{2, 1}(M, M)$
//! is non-zero, some differentials will have to be calculated by hand to determine the actual set
//! of $d_2$'s.
//!
//! # Usage
//! This asks for a module and a resolution in the usual way. It only works with the Milnor basis,
//! and the `@milnor` modifier can be omitted.
//!
//! If `concurrent` is enabled, it also asks for a save file for the C function. Computing the C
//! function is the most expensive part of the of the computation. If a save file is provided, we
//! read existing computations from the save file and write new ones into it. The same save file
//! can be reused for different ranges of the same module.
//!
//! # Output
//! We omit differentials if the target bidegree is zero
