//! This computes $d_2$ differentials in the Adams spectral sequence. This only works for fairly
//! specific modules, but tends to cover most cases of interest.
//!
//! # Usage
//! This asks for a module in the usual way, and verifies that the module satisfies the conditions
//! necessary for the algorithm the work. It only works with the Milnor basis.
//!
//! # Output
//! We omit differentials if the target bidegree is zero.
//!
//! # Sharding
//! *This section applies to all of the secondary scripts, namely `secondary`,
//! [`secondary_product`](../secondary_product/index.html)
//! and [`secondary_massey`](../secondary_massey/index.html).*
//!
//! Most of the computation can be fully distributed. Rudimentary sharding over multiple machines
//! is currently supported, where each machine works on a single `s`.
//!
//! These machines should share the same save directory (e.g. over a network-mounted drive), and
//! all prerequisites for the computation must have been computed. This includes the "primary" data
//! (resolutions, lifts, etc.) as well as the secondary prerequisites (the secondary resolution for
//! secondary products, secondary products for secondary Massey product). Otherwise, conflicts may
//! arise.
//!
//! To compute data for a single `s`, run the script with the environment variable
//! `SECONDARY_JOB=s`. The minimum value of `s` is the cohomological degree shift of the secondary
//! homotopy (i.e. the difference in degrees between the input class and the τ part of the answer;
//! 2 in the case of `secondary`), and the maximum value of `s` is the `max_s` of the resolution.
//!
//! After running this script for all `s` in the range, run it as usual to produce the final
//! output. An example script is as follows:
//!
//! ```shell
//! #!/bin/sh
//!
//! cargo run --example resolve_through_stem S_2 /tmp/save 40 20;
//!
//! cargo build --example secondary
//! for n in `seq 20 -1 2`; do
//!     SECONDARY_JOB=$n target/debug/examples/secondary S_2 /tmp/save 40 20 &
//! done
//!
//! wait
//!
//! target/debug/examples/secondary S_2 /tmp/save 40 20;
//! ```
