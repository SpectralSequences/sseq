# Message Passing Tree

This is a simple python message passing tree.

## Overview

We think of the root of the tree as the _innermost_ node and the leaves as the _outermost_ nodes,
so towards the root is _inwards_ and towards the leaves is _outwards_.
Each node in the tree is an instance of `Agent`.
An `Agent` has a parent inward of it (unless it is the root of the tree) and a list of children outward of it.
The `Agent`s pass _messages_ to each other. A _message_ consists of a _command_ and a list of arguments.
A _command_ is a dot separated string like `chart.class.add` or `error.client.TypeError`.
When an `Agent` receives an inbound message from any of its children, by default it passes the message inward to its parent.
When an `Agent` receives an outbound message from its parent, by default it passes the message outward to each of it's children.

Each `Agent` has a set of _command filters_ that it subscribes to and it will only receive messages from its parent that match one of the command filters they subscribe to.
For instance, if an agent is subscribed to the command filters `chart` and `display.background` then it will receive `chart.class.add`, `chart.edge.update`, and `display.background.set_color` but not `display.set_status`.

An `Agent` also has a set of transformers/consumers for inbound messages and a set of transformers/consumers for outbound messages. A transformer/consumer is a pair a command filter and a handler. When an `Agent` receives an inbound message, it looks to see whether the command matches any of the command filters that the agent transforms. If the command matches multiple command filters, the `Agent` always picks the most specific filter (in particular, it will only ever apply at most one transformer/consumer).
If the handler applied is a transfomer, then the `Agent` will pass the transformed message onward.
If the handler applied is a consumer, the `Agent` "consumes" the message and does not pass it onward.

## Definitions of Terms

-   A _command string_ is a string consisting of alphanumeric characters and dot "." or underscore "_".
    The command should not start or end with "." and should contain no two consecutive "."'s or "_"'s.

-   A _message_ is a triple a command, an argument list, and a key-value pair list.

-   A _command filter_ is a string which is either a command or the string "\*".

-   A command filter _matches_ a command if either
    (1) the command filter is "\*" or
    (2) the command filter is equal to the command or
    (3) the command filter is a prefix for the command and the next character is a ".".
    For example, "chart" matches "chart.class.add" but not "chart_class.add".

-   The characters "." and "\*" are not allowed in identiers.
    We map "command filters" to strings that are valid as parts of identifiers as follows:
    "\*" => "\_all"
    "." => "\_\_"
    Note that if the command filter contains "." or "\*" then the output of this transformation is not a valid command filter. We call this the associated _command filter subidentifier_.

-   A _transformer identifier_ is an identifier which:
    (1) starts with "transform\_"
    (2) is followed by a command filter subidentifier.

-   A _transformer method_ is a method whose name is a transformer identifier and which takes as a message input a source agent, a command, and a collection of key-value pairs and returns a new command and a new collection of key-value pairs.
-   A _consumer identifier_ is an identifier which:
    (1) starts with "consume\_"
    (2) is followed by a command filter subidentifier.

-   An `Agent` class consists of a triple:
    subscriptions: a list of messages that the `Agent` subscribes to from it's parent
    outward_transformers and inward_transformers: maps from command filters to transformers
    When the agent receives a message pointing inward, it checks if it has any inward transformers
    with command filters that match the message command. If so, it applies the inward transformer
    with the most specific match to the message before passing the message to it's parent.
