Description: # spectralsequence_chart
        This project is a Python implementation of the spectralsequence chart API.
        The Python chart API is a work in progress, and in particular there is currently no published spec.
        Hopefully I will make one soon.
        
        The script packager.py packages the library into an emscripten virtual file system, reverse engineered from [https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/master/tools/file_packager.py](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/master/tools/file_packager.py)
